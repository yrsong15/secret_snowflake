# Secret Snowflake :snowflake: :snowflake: :snowflake:

This program creates a Secret Snowflake matching (it's like Secret Santa, but not everyone celebrates Christmas :smile:).

It was motivated by my own experiences as a Resident Assistant, where I had to run a hacky Excel sort process just to randomly match names.

### Requirements

This program takes in a text file that contains a list of names, with each name separated by a **newline** character.

### Compile & Running

```
javac Main.java
java Main <insert title of text file here>

```
